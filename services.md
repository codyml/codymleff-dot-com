# Services

My skills and experience are relevant to many different jobs throughout web production and beyond.  My top priority is delivering highest-quality work.  Wondering if I may be able to help with something not listed below?  Please get in touch; if I think I can do a great job, I’d love to be involved.


## Consulting

Not sure where to start with your web project?  I’m well-versed in do-it-yourself website tools like Squarespace and Wix and how they compare to other web publication platforms, and can help you decide which solution might be best for you.  Have an existing web project and aren’t sure how to take it further?  I’m happy to get on the phone to discuss options or help you create a production roadmap that you can use to reach your goals.


## Branding

Establishing a brand identity allows you to offer your audience a cohesive, memorable visual experience that identifiably represents your project or organization.  Using an iterative discovery process, I can help express your project or organization’s character and personality as a brand, using graphic elements like logos, colors and fonts to create a branding kit and guidelines for use in your website, slide templates, stationery and more.


## Content

The focus of any website should be the content it presents.  Designing a clear, comprehensible content plan and hierarchy is one of the most important first steps for any web project.  I take the visitor’s perspective to create and refine a content model that will make the site content easy and enjoyable to navigate and consume.  Need help finding content for your site?  I can help source high-quality content from my network of writers, photographers and videographers.


## Design

I’m an experienced graphic, web, UX and UI designer with contemporary aesthetic and artistic instincts and a full awareness of the HCI expectations and best practices that a modern website or application should satisfy.  My design process is a conversation: using the client’s requirements as a starting point, we meet several times to clarify intention, identify inspiration work, focus on a direction, review alternates, solve issues and finalize a finished design.

As a web designer, I create attractive, well-organized pages that focus on presentation of content and are responsively designed for all screen sizes.  I prioritize a great user experience and design interfaces to make the intended interaction flows intuitive and effortless for the visitor.  I design easy-to-use user interfaces for web applications and create animations for added interactivity.

Interested in other graphic design work?  I design for many other mediums as well.


## Development

I’m a full-stack web developer with years of practical experience and a solid background in programming paradigms and methodologies.  For dynamic single-page applications, I’m most experienced with Node.js and Python servers and the React front-end ecosystem.  For templated sites that need a CMS for easy content administration, I’m also an advanced WordPress developer and write custom themes and plugins for design-build projects.  For sites that require both the ease of administration of a CMS-driven templated site and complex dynamic front-end components, I’m experienced at crafting REST-driven hybrid solutions that offer the best of both approaches.

I have experience with numerous other languages, platforms and libraries and enjoy learning new ones.  Here are some that I’ve used the most frequently:

##### Databases 
MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite

##### Server
Python/Flask, Python/Django, Node.js/Express, PHP/WordPress, PHP/Drupal, nginx, Apache, Jekyll

##### Client
SPA libraries: React/Redux, Vue.js, AngularJS
Mapping & visualization: D3.js, Google Maps API, Leaflet, Mapbox

##### Health
HL7 FHIR, SMART on FHIR, medical coding systems (ICD, LOINC, RxNorm)

##### Infrastructure
Linux shell, Git, Docker, AWS, Heroku, Webpack

For all development projects, clients can expect and efficient, test-driven and source-controlled development process with clear communication throughout and seamless collaboration with other developers when necessary.  After rigorous quality assurance and debugging, I coordinate with the client to review and deploy the final product, providing continuing support following deployment and administration training as necessary.


## Maintenance & Support

Do you need help with an existing website?  I can modify content or appearance, fix issues, run updates, set up backups, and more.  I’m familiar with most platforms and languages and can offer technical support on any project.

If you have an existing website and would like continuing managed services, I offer recurring plans for tasks like managing domain name and hosting accounts, running regular WordPress core and plugin updates, ensuring uptime and continued backups, and more.
